USER:
Produce description for a Hugr data source using input json, consider modules, tables, views and functions.

[INPUT JSON]
{
  "name": "{{ .Name }}",
  "description": "{{ .Description }}",
  "read_only": {{ .ReadOnly }},
  "as_module": {{ .AsModule }},
  "tables": {{ .TablesJSON }},
  "views": {{ .ViewsJSON }},
  "functions": {{ .FunctionsJSON }},
  "modules": {{ .SubmodulesJSON }},
}

[TASK]
Return ONE JSON with the exact shape below (English only; no extra keys):

{
  "short": "1–2 sentences: what this data source contains and key arguments",
  "long":  "≈400 tokens: business meaning and provided data/functions; key arguments and why;"
}

Constraints:
- Do NOT invent tables, views, functions, submodules or capabilities not present in the input.
- Do not use in descriptions the submodules, tables, views and function names, instead use their business meaning.
- Keep “short” succinct; keep “long” around 400 tokens; keep blurbs within the given limits.
- If the module name is empty (""), assume it's the root module - GraphQL schema.
- Imagine that the data source as a information system, describe its purpose and functionality.
- Do not mention technical details like "this is a Postgres data source or GraphQL API", instead focus on business meaning, which functions, data or analytics capabilities it provides.
